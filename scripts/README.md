# Scripts Directory

This directory contains utility scripts and tools for managing the AgentMath.app application.

## Directory Structure

### `/questions`
Question generation scripts that populate the database with math questions across various topics and difficulty levels.

### `/utils`
Utility scripts for database management, user administration, diagnostics, and maintenance tasks.

### `/archive`
Deprecated or unused code kept for reference.

## Usage

Most scripts in this directory are standalone utilities meant to be run once or occasionally for maintenance. They are not part of the core application and have been organized here to keep the root directory clean.

**Important:** These scripts should be run with caution, especially those that modify the database. Always backup your database before running migration or cleanup scripts.
